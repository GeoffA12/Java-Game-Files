# Java-Maze-Game

This is a Java Maze game which I programmed. The Maze.Java class wass supplied by Microsoft in an online course I took over Java Object-Oriented programming. I implemented the MazeRunner.Java class using the methods and attributes defined in the Maze.Java class. 

The Maze game follows a principle similar to Snakes in Ladders, in that the user is given a starting position on a board which is printed off incrementally throughout the game. The user must enter in a direction in which they want to move their character on the board until they reach a position which is the "winning" position they must travel to win the game. 

A few constraints on the game to make it more interesting are that the user only has 100 turns to find the hidden spot on the board. Also, the user can unexpectedly run into hidden walls on the board, which essentially waste a turn.
